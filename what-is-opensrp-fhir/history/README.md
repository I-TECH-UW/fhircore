## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Community health importance and some background

How big the problems are at the field, with governments, some of the things FHIR addresses, the key modules we have and why they are important.

Very brief timeline of how it got here from Karnataka, with photos.

## The "smart" register <a href="#in-the-field" id="in-the-field"></a>

OpenSRP FHIR is designed to be a highly intuitive tool based on existing tools.&#x20;

paint picture of why it is the way it is... Transition from paper, Focus on beginner user, Overseeing a large group of patients so needs to be easily scannable, The right way: less focus on data collection, more focus on providing care... not just data collection app and should not be.

Opportunity to have our say on what the "right" way is.... speed, ease of use, quick understanding of who's important, speed through data collection, usability is key.

#### Key baseline hypothesis statement (i.e. better tools means better health workers means better health services) <a href="#feedback-loops" id="feedback-loops"></a>

A system for monitoring is one of the core pillars of a hypertension control program based on the World Health Organization's [HEARTS technical package](https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/hearts-technical-package). By recording a high volume of follow-up visits by patients with hypertension, it's possible improve the health system more quickly. Fundamentally, Simple is a system of feedback loops to improve patient treatment and strengthen health systems.

Problems government and implementors care about with EMR systems and why this app is inherently a different approach. Launch, reliability, training, interoperability, SMART guidelines, FHIR standard.
