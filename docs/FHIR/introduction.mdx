``
-- This will just be an outline highlighting what FHIR is and the different FHIR concepts (and links to their documentation) that we utilize as OpenSRP especially to drive application workflows
  - The detailed documentation on how we use these concepts will be on the Writting fhir section.

### Overview

The OpenSRP Solution is natively based on the FHIR standard and data model.

FHIR, or [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources](https://hl7.org/fhir/), is a data standard evolved from HL7, which pioneered the field of health data exchange. Importantly, since its introduction a decade ago, it has become the globally accepted standard describing how to represent and exchange health data.

*mention that being FHIR native, most of the solutions functionality and workflows are guided by the different FHIR concepts*
