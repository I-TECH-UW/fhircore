# What is OpenSRP FHIR?

OpenSRP FHIR has two parts: a mobile app for Android devices and a web-based Dashboard.

#### OpenSRP Android app

The OpenSRP FHIR Android app is used by health workers to:

1. Enroll community members to a medical record system
2. Turn community members into patients by adding them to a care plan associated with their condition.&#x20;
3. Set future appointments for patients
4. Contact overdue patients to return them to care
5. Track an individual facility's performance at controlling patients' BPs
