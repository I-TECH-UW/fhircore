# What is OpenSRP FHIR?

OpenSRP FHIR has two parts: a mobile app for Android devices and a web-based Dashboard.

#### OpenSRP Android app

The OpenSRP FHIR Android app is used by health workers to:

1. Enroll community members to a medical record system
2. Turn community members into patients by adding them to a care plan associated with their condition
3. Set future services a patient should receive based on their care plan, and assign making sure the services happen to health team members as tasks
4. Clearly visualize overdue patients so the health team can return them to care
5. Track performance of providing services to patients at individual health care practitioner and facility levels.
